## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Description



## Usage

This is my Portfolio Website. This is what i will be using for future work applications. This is a very simple straightforward website. You can either scroll down to see the contents or you can click in one of the navigation links at the top like About Me, Work, Resume and Contact Me.
When you click in one of those they will automatically move you to the section you selected. This will save you time from scrolling down and searching the correct section.
Also if you click in one of the contact icons at the bottom of the page they should rendirect you to the correct contact platfor you selected.
