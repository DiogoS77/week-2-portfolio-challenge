# Week2 Portfolio Challenge

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Description

This project is basically a creation of my portfolio. This page contains a lot of information about me like an brief text about me, my picture, my Work, CV and Contacts. This website was build from the beginning and the main focus of it is to show a bit about me and show the skills i learned in the bootcamp until now. This webpage only contains html and css but i am planning to add some javascript in the future.

The biggest challenfes i found while doing it, was not know from where should i start. I didnt know if i should make the structure first and then add some style to it or making it progressive in a way that i make the first section make it the way i like it and then go to the next one.

I personally think making a portfolio is really important, because it allows you to show your skills and how hard can you work to make something look really good and professional. Also is something that can display your achievments and your information in a more organnised way.

I think this challenge helped understand how to start a webpage from scrap without any starter code and doing everything by myself.
There was quite a few stuff that this challenge helped me improve that i will be listing bellow.

* How to start coding whithout any starting code
* How to work around with css and html
* How to define a structure that i liked it
* Made me more confident


## Usage

This is my Portfolio Website. This is what i will be using for future work applications. This is a very simple straightforward website. You can either scroll down to see the contents or you can click in one of the navigation links at the top like About Me, Work, Resume and Contact Me.
When you click in one of those they will automatically move you to the section you selected. This will save you time from scrolling down and searching the correct section.
Also if you click in one of the contact icons at the bottom of the page they should rendirect you to the correct contact platfor you selected.
